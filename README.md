## 🧠 **Professional Summary**

Software engineer with a degree from an Argentine university and over 10 years of international experience developing web platforms, mobile applications, and leading teams in agile, distributed, and multicultural environments. Specialized in backend development (Node.js, TypeScript), clean architecture, and microservices.

I have collaborated with companies across Europe, Latin America, and the United States, combining strong technical expertise with leadership skills. I’ve led cross-functional teams, managing priorities, architecture, and people. I also mentored junior developers and new employees, supporting their integration and professional growth within the company.

In academia, I taught and mentored over 500 students at one of Argentina’s top universities. I also represented more than 3,000 students, voicing their concerns to university authorities and advocating for changes that helped more students graduate. These experiences greatly strengthened my leadership and communication skills from an early stage.

## 🎯 **Professional Objective**

My goal is to lead high-performing teams focused on delivering outstanding products that balance technical quality and user-centered design. I prioritize creating collaborative environments where everyone understands the product’s purpose, feels ownership, and works with autonomy.

I don’t enjoy working with zombies 🧟 — I love working with professionals who think critically and code with purpose, quality, and heart 🤩.
